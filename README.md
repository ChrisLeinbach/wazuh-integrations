# wazuh-integrations

This repository holds custom wazuh integrations that allow you to forward wazuh alerts to other systems.

**discord** - the discord integration can be used to forward alerts to dedicated discord channels via discord bot

**n8n** - n8n integration lets you handle alerts, e.g. you can create tickets in DFIR-IRIS / TheHive / SecurityOnion / Jira via webhooks/api calls - a custom workflow to combine wazuh and DFIR-IRIS will be uploaded soon
